# metarep

> what happens to visual representation in a meta-learning model

## Setup

For setup, you need to do the following things:


1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/candemircan/metarep.git
    ```

2. Run the setup script. This requires either `curl` or `wget` to be present on your system. If you don't have either, build a virtual environment manually and install the local package.
    ```bash
    cd metarep
    bash setup.sh
    ```

3. The project uses a lot of external data, which is not committed to the repository. You can download the data by running the following script:
    ```bash
    bash bin/get_data.sh
    ```

This requires `wget`.

4. If you want to run the visualisation documents (`bin/vis*qmd`), you need to install [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). After installing, you can render the documents with the following command, which will render them as html files into the `log` folder:
    ```bash
    quarto render .
    ```
