> what happens to visual representation in a meta-learning model

## Setup

For setup, you need to do the following things:


1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/candemircan/metarep.git
    ```

2. Run the setup script. This requires either `curl` or `wget` to be present on your system. If you don't have either, build a virtual environment manually and install the local package.
    ```bash
    cd metarep
    bash setup.sh
    ```
