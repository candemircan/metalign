# metalign


## Setup

For setup, you need to do the following things:


1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/candemircan/metalign.git
    ```

2. Run the setup script. This requires either `curl` or `wget` to be present on your system. If you don't have either, build a virtual environment manually and install the local package.
    ```bash
    cd metalign
    bash setup.sh
    ```

3. The project uses a lot of external data, which is not committed to the repository. You can download the data by running the following script, which requires `wget` and `curl`.
    ```bash
    bash bin/get_data.sh
    ```

## Folder Structure

```bash
├── bin # all the *.sh, *.slurm, and *py scripts
├── data # all the data generated by experiments and derivative artifacts, not committed except the base config
├── figures # all the standalone figures, not committed
├── metalign # the local package, contains all the custom functions and tests
├── logs # all the logs generated by the scripts
```
